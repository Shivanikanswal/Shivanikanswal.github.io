      I'm currently a computer science
      <a class="underline-link">student</a> building things for the web with some awesome people. I am pursuing my Bachelor's from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.gehu.ac.in" target="_blank">Graphic Era Hill University</a> 
    </p>

    <p>
      As a developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably blogging, reading post on quora or medium,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
